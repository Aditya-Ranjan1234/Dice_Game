**Dice Game**

This JavaScript-based dice game is a fun and interactive way for two players to compete against each other. Players take turns rolling a pair of virtual dice, with the game dynamically generating random numbers for each roll. The corresponding dice images are displayed on the webpage to simulate the dice rolls visually.

The rules are simple: the player with the higher roll wins the round. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw. The game interface updates in real-time to announce the winner of each round, making for an engaging experience.

To play the game:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Each player takes turns clicking the "Roll Dice" button to generate their roll.
3. The game announces the winner or indicates a draw after each roll.

Enjoy this entertaining diversion and have fun rolling the virtual dice!
